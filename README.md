Scripts:
npm run start:dev
This starts the web application on localhost:8080


Features:
The site features a smooth-scrolling single page application with some fun styling effects to give the site some character like a sticky navbar, animated buttons, carousel photos, and a parallax scrolling background on our testimonials.


User Log-In:
We have easily accessible register and login links to forms where they can sign up or log in. If a customer adds a service to their cart, they can log out and log back in later to find their product still in their cart.


Cart:
A customer will make an event request with our custom services form and choose their preference of the provided fields. They’ll hit add to cart and receive a message showing a successful add to their cart, where they can then remove an item, enter their shipping address or returning users can find their previous shipping address stored for a quicker checkout. After being guided through the automated PayPal payment site, their order will be sent to the admin and added to their order history.


Admin Panel:
Upon login with a secure admin-only username & password, an exclusive administrator navbar appears on the home page. There, they is able to view and manage all requested services, all completed orders, all active orders, and all currently registered users.
